# Research Paper Summarizer using OpenAI API

This project provides a powerful, AI-driven tool to **automatically summarize research papers (PDFs)** using the OpenAI GPT API. Designed for students, researchers, and professionals, it helps extract, chunk, and simplify dense academic content into concise, human-readable summaries.

> ‚ú® "Turn 20-page research papers into 2-minute reads."

## Features

- Upload any academic PDF paper
- Extracts full text using PyMuPDF
- Splits content into manageable chunks (based on tokens)
- Sends chunks to OpenAI's GPT API for summarization
- Combines all chunk summaries into one final abstract
- API key stored securely via environment variable


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lssdivya/research-paper-summarizer.git
cd research-paper-summarizer

2. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Set your OpenAI API Key**

Store it securely using environment variables:
Linux/macOS:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
Windows (CMD):
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

4. **Run the summarizer**

python summarizer.py
You‚Äôll be prompted to enter a PDF file path. The output will display summaries for each chunk and a final abstract at the end.
